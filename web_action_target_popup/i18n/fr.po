"Popup Target for Actions\n"
"=========================\n"
"This module adds a new target \"popup\" for actions alongside \"new\" and \"current\". This new \"popup\" target opens the\n"
"action in a new window but does not close the previous action window if this was already a pop-up window.\n"
"\n"
"Usage: set target=\"popup\" in actions opened from an action that has a target \"new\".\n"
"\n"
"Notes:\n"
"\n"
"- Calling an action with target=\"popup\" from the main window has the same effect as calling it with target=\"new\"\n"
"- For the moment, this only works for one level depth, i.e. for a popup window opened in another popup window.\n"
