"Stock Planning Improved\n"
"=======================\n"
"\n"
"This modules implement the improved planning to the stock module.\n"
"\n"
"Improved planning concept\n"
"-------------------------\n"
"The improved planning is a standardization of planning management in Odoo based on the following concepts:\n"
"\n"
"- A planning is made of several tasks linked together. Each task can happen only when all the previous tasks are done.\n"
"- Each task has two dates:\n"
"    - A due date which is the date before which the task is to be done at the latest. The due date is changed only when\n"
"      a major rescheduling occurs. It is calculated backwards, task by task, from the due date of rightmost task of the\n"
"      planning (which is usually the date at which we promised to deliver the product to the customer).\n"
"    - A planned date which is the date at which we imagine the task is going to be executed given the information we\n"
"      have now. The planned date should be changed each time we have a new information and should never be in the past\n"
"      (since we are today and the task is not done, we have the information that the task will be executed sometime from\n"
"      now, but not before). It is calculated forwards, task by task, from the task(s) currently in execution.\n"
"- When a task is done, the actual execution date and the planned date are the same, but the due date is unchanged.\n"
"- The only relevant way to measure whether the project is late or early is for each task to compare the due date and\n"
"  the planned date.\n"
"- Comparing the planned date with today's date gives a indication on the accuracy of the planning, not on whether we\n"
"  are late or early.\n"
"\n"
"Improved planning applied to stock\n"
"----------------------------------\n"
"In the stock module, the application of the improved planning concepts is the following:\n"
"\n"
"- Tasks are stock moves to be executed.\n"
"- Tasks links are links between stock moves made by the procurement rules (make-to-stock)\n"
"- The due date of a move is the date of the procurement order. It is represented by the \"date\" field of the stock move.\n"
"- The planned date of the move is the date at which we suppose the move will be performed. It is represented by the\n"
"  \"date expected\" field of the stock move.\n"
"- If a procurement is rescheduled, the \"date\" fields of its stock moves are also modified to reflect the new date. If\n"
"  one of the move has previous moves (make-to-order configuration), the procurement date for the previous moves is also\n"
"  modified, which will modify the date of the previous moves in turn.\n"
"- If a stock move is done at a given date and has a following move, the \"date expected\" of the latter will be updated\n"
"  accordingly.\n"
"- When \"date\" and \"date expected\" are updated, the delay taken between moves is the one of the procurement rule which\n"
"  generated the move."
"\n"
"Notes\n"
"-----\n"
"- This module interfaces with the other planning improved modules such as purchase and mrp.\n"
"- This module depends on stock_working_days module since no decent planning can be done without taking into account\n"
"  the working days.\n"
