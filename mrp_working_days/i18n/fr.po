"===============================\n"
"This modules enables scheduling of production orders on working days defined by resources and associated calendars.\n"
"n\"
"Each warehouse can have its own resource and associated calendar representing its opening days. If a warehouse is not\n"
"given a resource, then the system falls back to a company default calendar.\n"
"When a procurement needs to be scheduled by production, it counts only opened days defined by the applicable calendar.\n"
"n\"
"Notes:\n"
"------\n"

"- When no applicable calendar is found, the module's default calendar is used which sets working days from Monday to\n"
"Friday. This default calendar can be changed by authorized users.\n"
"n\"
"- For a given procurement, the applicable warehouse is the warehouse of the location of the procurement. It falls back\n"
"on the warehouse of the procurement itself only if no location is defined. This is to handle correctly\n"
"inter-warehouse procurement with chained moves where the warehouse of the procurement is the warehouse of the end of\n"
"the chain.\n"
