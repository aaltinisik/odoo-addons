"Purchase Planning Improved\n"
"===========================\n"
"This modules implement the improved planning to the purchase module.\n"
"Improved planning concept\n"
"-------------------------\n"
"The improved planning is a standardization of planning management in Odoo based on the following concepts:\n"
"- A planning is made of several tasks linked together. Each task can happen only when all the previous tasks are done.\n"
"- Each task has two dates:\n"
"    - A due date which is the date before which the task is to be done at the latest. The due date is changed only when\n"
"      a major rescheduling occurs. It is calculated backwards, task by task, from the due date of rightmost task of the\n"
"      planning (which is usually the date at which we promised to deliver the product to the customer).\n"
"    - A planned date which is the date at which we imagine the task is going to be executed given the information we\n"
"      have now. The planned date should be changed each time we have a new information and should never be in the past\n"
"      (since we are today and the task is not done, we have the information that the task will be executed sometime from\n"
"      now, but not before). It is calculated forwards, task by task, from the task(s) currently in execution.\n"
"- When a task is done, the actual execution date and the planned date are the same, but the due date is unchanged.\n"
"- The only relevant way to measure whether the project is late or early is for each task to compare the due date and\n"
"  the planned date.\n"
"- Comparing the planned date with today's date gives a indication on the accuracy of the planning, not on whether we\n"
"  are late or early.\n"
"Improved planning applied to purchase\n"
"-------------------------------------\n
"In the purchase module, the application of the improved planning concepts is the following:\n
"- Tasks are purchase order lines and stock moves associated to goods receipts.\n
"- Tasks links are links between purchase order lines dans stock moves made by the procurement rules (buy)\n
"- Purchase order lines are given a new field date called "date_required" which is the due date of the purchase order\n"
"  line.\n"
"- The "date_planned" field is the planned date of the receipt which is the date confirmed by the supplier.\n"
"- If a procurement is rescheduled, the "date_required" fields of its purchase order lines are also modified to reflect\n"
"  the new date.\n"
"Notes\n"
"-----\n"
"- This module depends on the stock_planning_improved module and interfaces with the other planning improved modules\n"
"  such as mrp.\n"
"- This module also depends on purchase_working_days module since no decent planning can be done without taking into\n'
"  account the working days.\n"
