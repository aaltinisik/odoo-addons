"Stock Transfer Split by Pack\n"
"==============================\n"
"This module will add a \"Split in Pack\" button in the stock transfer view next to the native \"Split\" button. This button\n"
"will open a pop-up window asking for a quantity and if we should create packs. The amount of the line will then be split\n"
"in multiple lines of the selected quantity and a pack will be created for these lines if the options was selected. The\n"
"remaining quantity, if any, will stay in the original line."
"\n"
"This module is largely inspired from Akretion & Odoo Community Association (OCA) stock_transfer_split_multi module.\n"
