"Purchase Schedule on Working Days\n"
"=================================\n"
"This modules enables scheduling of purchase order lead times on working days defined by resources and associated calendars.\n"
"Resources can be defined for suppliers. When defined, supplier lead time is calculated counting only the\n"
"working days of the supplier.\n"
"Notes:\n"
"------\n"
"- When no applicable calendar is found, the module's default calendar is used which sets working days from Monday to\n"
"  Friday. This default calendar can be changed by authorized users.\n"
"- Purchase security margin (po_lead) is calculated using our warehouse's resource and not the supplier resource. This\n"
"  is intended so that RFQ schedule dates always end up on our opening days.\n"
